# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification

This project focuses on building a robust image classification model that distinguishes between cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset and utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy. The final model can classify new, unseen images as either a cat or a dog, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios such as image-based search, animal identification, and pet monitoring systems.

Features:- 
Binary Image Classification: Classifies input images as either "Cat" or "Dog."
Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained VGG16 architecture to boost performance with feature extraction.
Data Augmentation: Applies techniques like rescaling, flipping, and zooming to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuned using Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss for fast convergence.
Technologies
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN.
Python: Language for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
Kaggle Dataset: Large-scale labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
Achievements
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the validation set.
Efficient Inference: Optimized for performance, allowing for fast predictions on both local machines and cloud deployments.
